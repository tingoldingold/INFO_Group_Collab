                 innovative and imaginative ideas that are brought to life by 
                 their users. Everything on Kickstarter must be a project with a
                 clear goal, like making an album, a book, or a work of art. A 
                 project will eventually be completed, and something will be

                 to bring to life. Think albums, books, or films. The funding 
                 goal is the amount of money that a creator needs to complete 
                 their project. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. No one
                 will be charged for a pledge towards a project unless it
                 reaches its funding goal. This way, creators always have the 
                 budget they scoped out before moving forward. A creator is the 
                 person or team behind the project idea, working to bring it to 
                 life. Backers are folks who pledge money to join creators in 
                 bringing projects to life. Rewards are a creator's chance to 
                 share a piece of their project with their backer community. 
                 Typically, these are one-of-a-kind experiences, limited

                 gets traffic from many different people but there are two 
                 groups in particular that serve as the main audiences: Backers
                 and Entrepreneurs. Although, the data we will present will be 
                 relevant to the entrepreneurs, our main target audience for 
                 this project will be the Backers. In More detail, these are 
                 the people that search this site funding projects they like and
                 think will be successful. Backers are offered rewards in terms 
                 of prizes, money and ownership in return for their monetary 
                 support. Unfortunately, only about 44% of these projects will 
                 be successful. Our aim will be to offer insights and tips into 
                 what makes a successful Kickstarter project that which will
                 prove to be most beneficial to potential Backers. "),

                 Some are just inspired by a new idea, while others are 
                 motivated to pledge by a project's rewards — a copy of what's 
                 being produced, a limited edition, or a custom experience 
                 related to the project. Backing a project is more than just 
                 pledging funds to a creator. It's pledging your support to a 
                 creative idea that you want to see exist in the world. The 
                 majority of initial funding usually comes from the fans and 
                 friends of each project. If they like it, they'll spread the 
                 word to their friends, and so on. Press, blogs, Twitter, 
                 Facebook, and Kickstarter itself are also big sources of 
                 traffic and pledges. Altogether, millions of people visit
