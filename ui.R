                 person or team behind the project idea, working to bring it to 
                 life. Backers are folks who pledge money to join creators in 
                 bringing projects to life. Rewards are a creator's chance to 
                 share a piece of their project with their backer community.

                 product offering and taking the time to look up projects in 
                 those categories might be a fruitful endeavor. Another

                 could also be attributed to a relatively low success rate.
