Kickstarter is a funding platform for everything from film, to
gaming, to music, art, and design. They try to host the most 
innovative and imaginative ideas that are brought to life by 
their users. Everything on Kickstarter must be a project with a
clear goal, like making an album, a book, or a work of art. A 
project will eventually be completed, and something will be 
produced by it.
